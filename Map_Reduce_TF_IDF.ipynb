family history of colon cancer i am going to have her discuss this further with dr xyz and leave further studies up to them i will dictate dr xyz a note i am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort she has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her this however has been some time ago i suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome i have strongly encouraged weight reduction both through diet and exercise i would like to see her back in the office in six months i did retake her blood pressure today and it was 13070 she is fasting this morning so we will get a fasting blood sugar chem 12 lipid profile and cpk i will her mail

aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery telemetry now reviewed shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent apcs  earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and i suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia which has been corrected there has been no atrial fibrillation documented i do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath she actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery i feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil which has been started which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia which she had and would watch for heart rate with that continued optimization of electrolytes the patient cannot take beta blockers as previously toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath although there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil the patient is aware of the cardiac risks certainly it is moderate and wishes to proceed with needed surgery i do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with dr x after discharge regarding her mild thrombocytopenia i would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease management

october of 2006 when he had onset of swelling and discomfort in the left testicle with what he described as a residual lump posteriorly the left testicle has continued to be painful off and on since in early november he developed pain in the posterior part of his upper right leg which he initially thought was related to skateboarding and muscle strain physical therapy was prescribed and the discomfort temporarily improved in december he noted onset of increasing fatigue he used to work out regularly lifting lifts doing abdominal exercises and playing basketball and found he did not have energy to pursue these activities he has lost 10 pounds since december and feels his appetite has decreased night sweats and cough began in december for which he was treated with a course of augmentin

on admission with hypertension that was treated with labetalol en route her heart rate was 130 she was brought down with cardizem she received the study drug in the night and about an hour later thought to have another large stroke effecting the opposite side of the brain that the doctors and company think is probably cardioembolic and not related to the study drug as tpa has no obvious known association with thisat that time the patient became comatose and required emergent intubation and paralyzation her diastolic at that time rose up to 190 likely the result of the acute second stroke

in critical condition and stable with multiple strokes one must also wonder if she could have a large clot burden below the heart and patent foramen ovale etc we need stat records from her prior cardiologist and prior echocardiogram report to see exactly what are the details i have ordered a stat echo and to have the group that sees her read it that if he has a large clot burdened in the heart or has distal clot with a pfo we may be able to better prognosticate at this point obviously she cannot have any anticoagulants except for the study drug at present which is her only chance and hopefully they will be able to retrieve most of the clot with emergency retrieval device as activated heroically by dr a and interventional radiology2 hypertensionatrial fibrillation this will be a difficult management and the fact that she has been on a beta blocker for parkinsons she may have withdrawal to the beta blockers as we remove this given her atrial fibrillation i do agree the safest agent right now is to use a cardizem drip as needed and would use it for systolic greater than 160 to 180 or diastolics greater than 90 to 100 also would use it to control the atrial fibrillation we would however be very cautious not to put her in heart block with the digoxin and the beta blocker on board weighing all risks and benefits i think that given the fact that she has a beta blocker on board and digoxin we would like to avoid the beta blocker for vasospasm protection and will favor using calcium channel blocker for now if however we run into trouble with this i would prefer to switch her to brevibloc or an esmolol drip and see how she does as she may withdraw from the beta blocker i will be watching this closely and managing the hypertension as i see fit at the moment based on all factors will also ask cardiology if she has one that sees her here to help guide this her digoxin level is appropriate as well as a tsh i do not feel that we need to work this up further other than the stat echo and ultrasound of the leg3 respiratory failure requiring ventilator i have discussed this with dr devlin we do not feel the need to hyperventilate her at present we will keep her comfortable on the breathing machine and try to keep her ph in a normal range around 74 and her co2 in the 30 to 40 range if she has brain swelling we will need to hyperventilate her to a pco2 of 30

of long acting central nervous system acting medications to sedate her and can produce a lasting sedation throughout the daytime these include trazodone seroquel and methadone of these medications the
